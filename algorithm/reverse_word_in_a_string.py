"""
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

Clarification
What constitutes a word?
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word and
some words have punctuation at the end.
Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
How about multiple spaces between two words?
Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

    # @param s : A string
    # @return : A string

        #strip()去掉s头尾的空格，split()按照空格分割字符串，reversed翻转，''.join按照空格连接字符串
